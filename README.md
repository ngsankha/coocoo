Coocoo
======
Coocoo sends notifications, just about anywhere - your laptop or your phone.

Just call Coocoo after any long running program or build to notify you that it has been done. Simple, easy, convenient! Don't keep on checking repeatedly if the task is over. Just grab a coffee and let the pigeon coo.

This is a [@sankha93](https://twitter.com/sankha93) pigeon.
